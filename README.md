# greek-mythology-data

Collections of greek mythological figures.

# ⚠️ Work in Progress ⚠️

This is an attempt at making an easy to use api about greek mythology. It is very far from being complete yet.

So far you only have the names and the category ( as type ) of the mythological figures.

I have to find a way to add descriptions, relations to others, etc...

If you want to open issues about what should be added, (data, methods, etc...), please do so in github.

Please contribute :)  
Feedback is appreaciated. :)
